Experiments were conducted as part of research into "The number of people living in a household".

1788 households were used in the experiments, and they each had their Annual household income in Philippine peso(Total.Household.Income), the region of the Philippines(Region), annual expenditure by the household on food in Philippine peso(Total.Food.Expenditure), head of the households sex(Household.Head.Sex), head of the households age in years(Household.Head.Age), relationship between the group of people living in the house(Type.of.Household), number of people living in the house(Total.Number.of.Family.members), floor area of the house(House.Floor.Area) in $m^2$, Age of the building in years(House.Age), number of bedrooms in the house(Number.of.bedrooms), whether the house have electricity with 1 is Yes and 0 is No)(Electricity).

No missing or undefined values are included in the dataset, and Total.Number.of.Family.members is given against the attributes of each household, including Total.Household.Income, Region, Total.Food.Expenditure, Household.Head.Sex, Household.Head.Age, Type.of.Household, House.Floor.Area, House.Age, Number.of.bedrooms and Electricity.
